# Lua Type Error: Arithmetic on String

This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming: attempting to perform arithmetic operations on strings.  Lua's dynamic typing allows for this, but it can lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.  The `bug.lua` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version.
